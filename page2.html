        <p>There are many types of skiing, but there are 4 main categories of skiing that are
            <br>the most recognizable.
            <ul>
                <li>Nordic</li>
                <li>Alpine</li>
                <li>Telemark</li>
                <li>Competition</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            Nordic skiing is marked by a difference in skiing boot, and is mostly comprised of
            <br>cross-country and skijumping disciplines. Nordic skiers have a unique boot that
            <br>doesn't attach at the heel, meaning skiers can lift most of their foot of the
            <br>ski without risk. Nordic skiing can be practiced in backcountry or on marked 
            <br>groomed trails. Alpine skiing, also known as downhill skiing, was created around
            <br>the same time as ski lifts, because skiers no longer had to hike or ski uphill
            <br>like in Nordic skiing.

        <p>
            Alpine skiing, also known as downhill skiing, was created around
            <br>the same time as ski lifts, because skiers no longer had to hike or ski uphill
            <br>like in Nordic skiing. Alpine skiing was origninally very similar to Nordic
            <br>skiing because it split off of it, but has since change significantly. Some of
            <br>the most notable differences between Nordic and Alpine is how the Alpine
            <br>skiing boot is shaped, with an extra hook around the heel and significantly
            <br>different techniques.
